# Some ideas :)
Your password is encrypted with a magic salt once you create a new host and you need that magic salt every time you want to copy/paste the host password in your clipboard from the browser. It can be a collaborative free tool to share access to multiple server access. Password Protected page can also be added!

# Requirements

Node server + Web Server (Nginx or Apache or whatever you like...)

# Instructions

Install npm packages
```bash
 npm install
```

Start Shell Server
```bash
 npm run shell

```
# Have a good time hacking!
