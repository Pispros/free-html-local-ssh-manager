# Fonctionnalities & Some ideas :)
Once you click on "command" button, a terminal is launched with ssh command to remote host. Your password is encrypted with a magic salt once you create a new host and you need that magic salt every time you want to copy/paste the host password in your clipboard from the browser. It can be a collaborative free tool to share access to multiple servers. Password Protected page can also be added!
